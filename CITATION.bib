Hash Consing Optimization: SymbolicUtils.jl now uses hash consing to eliminate duplicate 
symbolic expressions in memory and enable faster equality comparisons. This optimization 
significantly improves performance for complex symbolic computations by reducing memory 
overhead and computation time. Available starting from v3.28.0.
